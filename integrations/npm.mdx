## Overview

The npm registry integration enables Backline to monitor your npm packages for security vulnerabilities. Stay informed about security issues in your JavaScript and Node.js dependencies.

## What You Can Do

With the npm integration, Backline can:
- Scan npm packages for known vulnerabilities
- Monitor package dependencies
- Track security advisories
- Identify outdated packages with security fixes
- Provide upgrade recommendations

## Prerequisites

Before connecting npm, ensure you have:
- npm packages in use across your projects
- Access to your npm registry (public or private)
- npm authentication token (for private registries)

## Connecting npm Registry

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to the Integration Hub from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select npm">
    Find and click on the npm integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Registry Type">
    Select public npm registry or enter private registry URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Authentication">
    For private registries, provide your npm authentication token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to complete the integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Connection

Once npm is connected, Backline will:
1. Analyze package.json and lock files from connected repositories
2. Check packages against vulnerability databases
3. Identify security issues in dependencies
4. Recommend version upgrades and patches

## Vulnerability Detection

Backline identifies:
- Known security vulnerabilities in npm packages
- Outdated packages with available security patches
- Deprecated packages
- Transitive dependency vulnerabilities

<Note>
  Backline automatically scans packages when it detects package.json or package-lock.json files in your connected repositories.
</Note>

## Remediation

For npm vulnerabilities, Backline can:
- Suggest safe package version upgrades
- Create pull requests updating package.json and lock files
- Highlight breaking changes in upgrades
- Provide alternative package recommendations

<Tip>
  Enable automated remediation to let Backline create pull requests for safe npm package updates.
</Tip>

## Managing the Integration

### Updating Settings
To modify npm configuration:
1. Open the Integration Hub
2. Click on the npm integration
3. Update registry URL or authentication
4. Test and save changes

### Disconnecting
To remove the npm integration:
1. Go to the Integration Hub
2. Click on the npm integration
3. Select **Disconnect**
4. Confirm the disconnection

<Warning>
  Disconnecting stops npm vulnerability monitoring. Existing npm-related findings remain but won't be updated.
</Warning>
