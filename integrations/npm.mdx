## Overview

Use this integration to grant Backline read-only access to your private NPM registry. This allows Backline to work with repositories that depend on packages hosted there.

## What You Can Do

With the npm integration, Backline can:
- Access private npm packages required by your repositories
- Analyze dependencies from your private registry
- Work with repositories that depend on packages hosted in your private registry

## Prerequisites

Before connecting npm, ensure you have:
- A private npm registry
- Ability to generate read-only access tokens for your registry
- The registry URL for your npm instance

## Connecting npm

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Read-Only Token">
    In your npm registry, create a read-only access token. This token will allow Backline to access your private packages without modification permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Registry URL">
    Get the URL for your private npm registry (e.g., https://registry.npmjs.org/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    In Backline, go to the Integration Hub from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select npm">
    Find and click on the npm integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Credentials">
    Provide your registry details:
    - **Registry Token**: Your read-only access token
    - **Registry URL**: The URL of your private npm registry
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Connection">
    Click **Connect** to complete the integration setup.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Connection

Once npm is connected, Backline will:
1. Use the provided credentials to access your private registry
2. Retrieve packages needed for dependency analysis in your repositories
3. Analyze dependencies from both public and private npm packages

<Note>
  The read-only token ensures Backline can only access packages without making any modifications to your registry.
</Note>

## Managing the Integration

### Updating Settings
