## Overview

The GitLab integration enables Backline to access your GitLab repositories, identify security vulnerabilities, and create merge requests with automated fixes. Connect GitLab to unlock powerful automated remediation capabilities for your projects.

## What You Can Do

With the GitLab integration, Backline can:
- Access your GitLab projects and groups
- Scan repositories for security vulnerabilities
- Analyze dependencies and detect outdated packages
- Create merge requests with security patches
- Track remediation progress across your GitLab projects

## Prerequisites

Before connecting GitLab, ensure you have:
- A GitLab account (GitLab.com or self-hosted)
- Maintainer or Owner role in the projects you want to connect
- API access enabled for your GitLab instance

## Connecting GitLab

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Connection">
    Click **Connect** to begin the authorization process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Access">

## Permissions Required

Backline needs the following GitLab permissions:
- Read access to repositories and project information
- Write access to merge requests
- Read access to dependency information

<Note>
  These permissions enable Backline to scan your code and submit security fixes via merge requests.
</Note>

## After Connection

Once GitLab is connected, Backline will:
1. Discover and catalog your projects
2. Begin vulnerability scanning
3. Generate remediation recommendations
4. Create merge requests for approved fixes

<Tip>
  For self-hosted GitLab instances, ensure Backline can reach your server through your network configuration.
</Tip>
