description: "Scan container images in Azure Container Registry"
---

## Overview

The Azure ACR (Azure Container Registry) integration enables Backline to scan your container images hosted in Azure for security vulnerabilities. Ensure your containerized applications are secure before deployment.

## What You Can Do

With the ACR integration, Backline can:
- Scan container images in your Azure registries
- Analyze image layers for vulnerabilities
- Detect security issues in dependencies
- Track image security across versions
- Monitor compliance with security policies

## Prerequisites

Before connecting ACR, ensure you have:
- An Azure account with ACR registries
- Azure Service Principal or credentials
- Permission to access container registries
- Registry login server information

## Connecting ACR

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to the Integration Hub from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select ACR">
    Find and click on the Azure ACR integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Registry Details">
    Provide your ACR registry name and login server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Credentials">
    Enter your Azure Service Principal credentials or admin credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to complete the integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required Azure Permissions

Your credentials need these ACR permissions:
- Read access to repositories
- Pull images
- Read image manifests
- List repository tags

<Tip>
  Use a Service Principal with Reader role on your ACR resource for secure, limited access.
</Tip>

## After Connection

Once ACR is connected, Backline will:
1. List all registries and repositories
2. Begin scanning tagged images
3. Analyze vulnerabilities in image layers
4. Provide remediation guidance

## Image Scanning

Backline examines:
- All images in connected registries
- Base image vulnerabilities
- Application dependencies within containers
- Configuration weaknesses

<Note>
  Initial scans may take time depending on image size and quantity. Backline performs incremental scans for efficiency.
</Note>

## Managing the Integration

### Updating Registry Access
To modify credentials or registries:
1. Open the Integration Hub
2. Click on the ACR integration
3. Update your registry details or credentials
4. Test and save changes

### Disconnecting
To remove the ACR integration:
1. Go to the Integration Hub
2. Click on the ACR integration
3. Select **Disconnect**
4. Confirm the disconnection

<Warning>
  Disconnecting stops scanning of Azure container images. Existing findings remain but won't be refreshed.
</Warning>
