description: "Sync vulnerabilities and remediations with Jira tickets"
---

## Overview

The Jira integration connects Backline with your Jira instance, allowing you to automatically create tickets for vulnerabilities, track remediation work, and keep your security and development workflows in sync.

## What You Can Do

With the Jira integration, Backline can:
- Automatically create Jira tickets for vulnerabilities
- Sync vulnerability status with Jira issue status
- Link remediations to existing Jira tickets
- Update tickets when vulnerabilities are resolved
- Track remediation work in your team's existing workflow

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Jira, ensure you have:
- A Jira account (Cloud or Server)
- Permission to create and manage issues
- Admin access to install integrations (for Jira Cloud)
- API token or credentials (for Jira Server)

## Connecting Jira

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integration Hub">
    Navigate to Integrations from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Jira">
    Find and click on the Jira integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Instance Type">
    Select Jira Cloud or Jira Server/Data Center.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Follow the authorization flow for your Jira instance type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Select your Jira project and configure ticket creation preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    Finish the setup and return to Backline.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions Required

Backline needs the following Jira permissions:
- Create and edit issues
- Read project and issue information
- Add comments to issues
- Transition issue status

<Note>
  These permissions enable Backline to create and manage security-related tickets in your Jira projects.
</Note>

## Ticket Creation

Configure how Backline creates Jira tickets:
- **Automatic**: Create tickets for all vulnerabilities above a certain severity
- **Manual**: Create tickets on demand from the Backline interface
- **Project Selection**: Choose which Jira project receives tickets
- **Issue Type**: Configure the issue type for vulnerability tickets

## Status Synchronization

Keep Backline and Jira in sync:
- When a vulnerability is resolved in Backline, the Jira ticket is updated
- When a Jira ticket is closed, the vulnerability status updates in Backline
- Comments and updates flow between both systems

## Managing the Integration
