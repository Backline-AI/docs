## Overview

Link your Jira projects to automatically create and update issues based on Backline Findings and Remediations.

## What You Can Do

With the Jira integration, Backline can:
- Automatically create and update Jira issues for vulnerabilities
- Update tickets when pull requests are opened for remediation
- Update tickets when pull requests are merged and remediation is resolved
- Add Jira ticket references to associated pull request descriptions
- Track remediation work in your team's existing workflow

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Jira, ensure you have:
- A Jira Cloud instance
- Ability to create a service account in your Jira Cloud domain
- Access to generate API tokens
- Your Atlassian Cloud ID

## Connecting Jira

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Service Account">
    Create a dedicated service account in your Jira Cloud domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Token">
    Generate an API token from the service account. Visit: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

    Add the needed scopes (Classic or Granular - see below), generate the token, and copy it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Cloud ID">
    Retrieve your Atlassian Cloud ID. Follow the instructions at: https://support.atlassian.com/jira/kb/retrieve-my-atlassian-sites-cloud-id/
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    In Backline, go to the Integration Hub from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Jira">
    Find and click on the Jira integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Credentials">
    Provide your connection details:
    - **API Token**: The token you generated in Step 2
    - **Cloud ID**: Your Atlassian Cloud ID from Step 3
    - **Email Address**: The email address of the service account used to generate the token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Click **Connect** to verify your credentials. Once verified, you'll move to the Configuration tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Backline supports Jira Cloud only.
</Note>

## API Token Scopes

When creating your API token, you can choose between Classic or Granular scopes:

### Classic Scopes

```
read:jira-work
read:jira-user
write:jira-work
```

### Granular Scopes

```
read:avatar:jira
read:board-scope:jira-software
read:comment:jira
read:comment.property:jira
read:custom-field-contextual-configuration:jira
read:field.default-value:jira
read:group:jira
read:issue:jira
read:issue-details:jira
read:issue-field-values:jira
read:issue-type:jira
read:issue-type.property:jira
read:issue-type-screen-scheme:jira
read:label:jira
read:project:jira
read:project-role:jira
read:project.component:jira-platform
read:screen-scheme:jira
read:screen-tab:jira
read:screenable-field:jira
read:sprint:jira-software
read:status:jira
read:user:jira
write:comment:jira
write:issue:jira
```

## Configuring Projects

After connecting, you'll need to configure which Jira projects Backline should use:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Jira Project">
    In the Configuration tab, choose a Jira Project from the list of available projects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Issue Type">
    Select the desired issue type you want Backline to create or update for vulnerability tickets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Fields">
    Once the issue type is chosen, the list of mandatory and optional fields from Jira will appear. You must map each Jira field to one of the following:
    - A value from Jira
    - A field from Backline
    - A manually added value

    **Important**: Special fields such as Severity and Priority must be mapped to internal Backline fields.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Complete the field mapping and save your project configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Updates

Once a scanned vulnerability is associated with a Jira ticket, Backline will automatically:
- Update the ticket when a pull request is opened for remediation
- Update the ticket when the pull request is merged and remediation is resolved
- Add the Jira ticket reference to the associated pull request description

## Managing the Integration

### Managing Projects

To view and manage your connected Jira projects:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Management">
    From the Jira Integration card, click the **three dots menu** and choose **Manage Project**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Connected Projects">
    You'll see all connected Jira projects listed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit or Delete">
    For each connected project, you can:
    - **Edit** the configuration to modify field mappings or issue types
    - **Delete** the project to remove the connection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add More Projects">
    Click **Add Project** to configure additional Jira projects.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Connect a messaging integration like Slack to receive notifications if there's an issue connecting or updating a ticket during the remediation process.
