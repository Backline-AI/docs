description: "Scan container images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry"

## Overview

The Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) integration allows Backline to scan your container images for security vulnerabilities. Identify and remediate security issues in your Docker images before they reach production.

## What You Can Do

With the ECR integration, Backline can:
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Analyze image layers and dependencies
- Detect outdated base images
- Track vulnerabilities across image versions
- Monitor container security compliance

## Prerequisites

Before connecting ECR, ensure you have:
- An AWS account with ECR repositories
- AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)
- IAM permissions to access ECR
- Repositories you want to scan

## Connecting ECR

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integration Hub">
    Navigate to Integrations from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select ECR">
    Find and click on the Amazon ECR integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter AWS Credentials">
    Provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Region">
    Choose the AWS region where your ECR repositories are located.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to complete the integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required IAM Permissions

Your AWS credentials need the following ECR permissions:
```
ecr:GetAuthorizationToken
ecr:DescribeRepositories
ecr:DescribeImages
ecr:BatchGetImage
ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer
```

<Tip>
  Create a dedicated IAM user for Backline with only the necessary ECR permissions following the principle of least privilege.
</Tip>

## After Connection

Once ECR is connected, Backline will:
1. Discover your ECR repositories
2. Begin scanning container images
3. Identify vulnerabilities in image layers
4. Generate remediation recommendations

## Image Scanning

Backline scans:
- All tagged images in connected repositories
- Base image vulnerabilities
- Package and dependency vulnerabilities within containers
- Configuration issues

<Note>
  Large images may take several minutes to scan initially. Subsequent scans are incremental and faster.
</Note>

## Managing the Integration

### Updating Credentials
To change AWS credentials:
1. Open the Integration Hub
2. Click on the ECR integration
3. Enter new credentials
4. Test and save

### Disconnecting
To remove the ECR integration:
1. Go to the Integration Hub
2. Click on the ECR integration
3. Select **Disconnect**
4. Confirm your choice

<Warning>
  Disconnecting will stop container image scanning. Existing vulnerability data will remain but won't be updated.
</Warning>
