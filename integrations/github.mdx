## Overview

Backline's GitHub integration enables secure, automated pull requests directly in your repositories, streamlining vulnerability remediation through our GitHub App.

## What You Can Do

With the GitHub integration, Backline can:
- Access your repositories across multiple organizations
- Analyze code dependencies and packages
- Create pull requests with automated security fixes
- Track remediation status across your GitHub projects

## Prerequisites

Before connecting GitHub, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account with appropriate permissions
- Admin access to the repositories you want to connect
- Organization owner rights (if connecting organization repositories)

## Connecting GitHub

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    In Backline, go to the Integration Hub from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select GitHub">
    Find and click on the GitHub integration card.

## After Connection

Once connected, Backline will:
1. Index your repositories
2. Generate remediation plans for vulnerabilities from those repositories
3. Create pull requests for automated fixes

## Managing the Integration

### Adding Multiple Organizations

You can connect multiple GitHub organizations to Backline:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integration Details">
    Go to the GitHub integration card in the Integration Hub and click **Configure** to open the integration details.

All connected organizations will be displayed in the integration details page.

### Testing Connections

To verify that a connection is still valid:

1. Open the integration details by clicking **Configure** on the GitHub integration card
2. Find the organization card you want to test
3. Click the **three dots menu** on the organization card
4. Select **Test Connection** to check if the connection is valid

### Disconnecting

To disconnect a GitHub organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integration Menu">
    In the Integration Hub, click the **three dots menu** on the GitHub integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Disconnect">
    Click the **Disconnect** option from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Uninstall on GitHub">

    Once you return to Backline, refresh the page to see that the connection to the GitHub organization was disconnected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Disconnecting will stop all automated remediation activities and prevent new vulnerability scanning for that organization.
</Warning>
