## Overview

The GitHub integration allows Backline to access your repositories, scan for vulnerabilities, and automatically create pull requests with security fixes. This integration is essential for enabling automated remediation workflows.

## What You Can Do

With the GitHub integration, Backline can:
- Access your repositories to scan for security vulnerabilities
- Analyze code dependencies and packages
- Create pull requests with automated security fixes
- Track remediation status across your GitHub projects
- Monitor vulnerability trends in your codebase

## Prerequisites

Before connecting GitHub, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account with appropriate permissions
- Admin access to the repositories you want to connect
- Organization owner rights (if connecting organization repositories)

## Connecting GitHub

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to the Integration Hub from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select GitHub">
    Find and click on the GitHub integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Click **Connect** to start the OAuth authorization flow. You'll be redirected to GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant Access">
    Review the requested permissions and click **Authorize** on GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install App">
    Choose which repositories to grant access to (all repositories or selected ones).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    You'll be redirected back to Backline with GitHub connected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions Required

Backline requires the following GitHub permissions:
- Read access to code and metadata
- Write access to pull requests
- Read access to security alerts (if available)

<Note>
  These permissions allow Backline to scan your code and create remediation pull requests. Your code is never stored outside your infrastructure.
</Note>

## After Connection

Once connected, Backline will:
1. Begin scanning connected repositories
2. Collect vulnerability information
3. Start generating remediation suggestions
4. Create pull requests for automated fixes

<Tip>
  Initial scanning may take several minutes depending on repository size. Check the Dashboard for progress.
</Tip>

## Managing the Integration

### Changing Repository Access
To add or remove repositories:
1. Visit your GitHub Settings
2. Navigate to Applications → Installed GitHub Apps
3. Find Backline and click **Configure**
4. Adjust repository access as needed

### Disconnecting
To disconnect GitHub from Backline:
1. Go to the Integration Hub
2. Click on the GitHub integration
3. Select **Disconnect**
4. Confirm your choice

<Warning>
  Disconnecting will stop all automated remediation activities and prevent new vulnerability scanning.
</Warning>
