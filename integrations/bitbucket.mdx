## Overview

The Bitbucket integration allows Backline to connect with your Bitbucket Cloud or Bitbucket Server repositories, scan for security vulnerabilities, and create pull requests with automated remediation fixes.

## What You Can Do

With the Bitbucket integration, Backline can:
- Access your Bitbucket repositories and workspaces
- Scan code for security vulnerabilities
- Analyze dependencies and identify risks
- Create pull requests with automated security fixes
- Monitor remediation status across Bitbucket projects

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Bitbucket, ensure you have:
- A Bitbucket account (Cloud or Server)
- Admin access to the repositories you want to connect
- Workspace admin rights (for Bitbucket Cloud)

## Permissions Required

Backline requires the following Bitbucket permissions:
- Read access to repositories
- Write access to pull requests
- Read access to repository metadata

<Note>
  These permissions allow Backline to scan your repositories and create pull requests for security fixes.
</Note>

## After Connection

Once Bitbucket is connected, Backline will:
1. Index your repositories
2. Start scanning for vulnerabilities
3. Generate remediation plans
4. Create pull requests for automated fixes

<Tip>
  For Bitbucket Server installations, ensure your server is accessible from Backline's infrastructure or configure appropriate network access.
</Tip>

## Managing the Integration

### Modifying Repository Access
To change which repositories Backline can access:
1. Go to your Bitbucket workspace settings
2. Navigate to OAuth consumers

### Disconnecting
To disconnect Bitbucket:
1. Open the Integration Hub
2. Click on the Bitbucket integration
3. Select **Disconnect**
4. Confirm your decision

<Warning>
  Disconnecting will stop all vulnerability scanning and automated remediation for Bitbucket repositories.
