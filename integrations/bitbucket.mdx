description: "Connect your Bitbucket repositories to Backline"

## Overview

Backline integrates with Bitbucket to automatically create secure pull requests that remediate known vulnerabilities in your repositories. This streamlines the remediation process and helps keep your codebase secure.

## What You Can Do

With the Bitbucket integration, Backline can:
- Access your Bitbucket repositories and workspaces
- Analyze dependencies and identify risks
- Create pull requests with automated security fixes
- Monitor remediation status across Bitbucket projects

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Bitbucket, ensure you have:
- A Bitbucket workspace with appropriate access
- Ability to create a service account with Admin role
- Access to generate API tokens for the service account

## Connecting Bitbucket

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Service Account">
    Create a Bitbucket service account with Admin role scoped to a single workspace. This dedicated account will be used exclusively for Backline's integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Token">
    In Bitbucket, navigate to your service account settings and create an API token with the required permissions (listed below).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Integration Hub">
    In Backline, navigate to Integrations from the main menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Bitbucket">
    Find and click on the Bitbucket integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Credentials">
    Provide your service account details:
    - **Atlassian Account Email**: The email address of your Bitbucket service account
    - **API Token**: The API token generated in Step 2
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Click **Connect** to verify your credentials. Once verified, Backline will securely link to your Bitbucket workspace and enable automated remediation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Token Configuration

The API token is used to authenticate with the Bitbucket API. This token must have access to the required repositories, pull requests, pipelines, and webhooks.

### Required Scopes

Configure your Bitbucket API token with the following scopes:

**Read Permissions:**
- `read:account` - Access account information
- `read:project:bitbucket` - Read project details
- `read:pullrequest:bitbucket` - View pull requests
- `read:repository:bitbucket` - Access repository content
- `read:user:bitbucket` - Read user information
- `read:webhook:bitbucket` - View webhook configurations
- `read:workspace:bitbucket` - Access workspace details
- `read:pipeline:bitbucket` - Monitor pipeline status

**Write Permissions:**
- `write:pullrequest:bitbucket` - Create and update pull requests
- `write:repository:bitbucket` - Make changes to repositories
- `write:webhook:bitbucket` - Configure webhooks for event notifications

<Note>
  These permissions allow Backline to access your repositories and create pull requests for security fixes while maintaining visibility into your workspace structure.
</Note>

## After Connection

Once Bitbucket is connected, Backline will:
1. Index your repositories
2. Generate remediation plans for vulnerabilities from those repositories
3. Create pull requests for automated fixes

## Managing the Integration

### Modifying Repository Access
To change which repositories Backline can access:
1. Go to your Bitbucket workspace settings
2. Navigate to OAuth consumers
3. Find Backline and adjust permissions
