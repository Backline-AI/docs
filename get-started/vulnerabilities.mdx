## Filtering and Search

Find specific vulnerabilities quickly using multiple filter options:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Available Filters">
    - **Text Search**: Search by vulnerability title or description
    - **Source**: Filter by the scanner that detected the issue
    - **Type**: Filter by vulnerability type
    - **Severity**: Show only specific severity levels
    - **Origin**: Filter by repository name
    - **Issue**: The vulnerability identifier
    - **SLA**: Filter by time to SLA deadline
