## Overview

The Dashboard provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of your organization's risk exposure. Visualize vulnerability trends, track remediation progress, and identify areas requiring immediate attention.

## Dashboard Components

### Remediation Performance

Monitor how effectively your team is addressing security issues:
- Average resolution time
- Success rates
- Automated vs. hybrid remediation performance
- SLA compliance rates

### Vulnerabilities Summary

Get an instant overview of your security landscape:
- **Total Unresolved Vulnerabilities**: Current count of open security issues
- **Severity Breakdown**: Distribution across Critical, High, Medium, and Low severities
- **SLA Violations**: Number of vulnerabilities exceeding SLA deadlines

<Tip>
  Click on any severity level in the summary card to quickly filter and view those specific vulnerabilities.
</Tip>

### Remediation Summary

Track your remediation efforts:
- **Active Remediations**: Currently in-progress fixes
- **Pending Remediations**: Fixes awaiting review or action
- **Priority Distribution**: Breakdown of remediations by priority level

<Tip>
  Click on remediation counts to navigate to filtered views of the Remediations page.
</Tip>

### Remediation Pipeline

An interactive Sankey chart visualizing the complete remediation workflow:
- **Vulnerability Sources**: Where vulnerabilities originate
- **Flow Paths**: Movement through different remediation stages
- **Status Progression**: How vulnerabilities are being resolved

**Interactive Features:**
- Hover over flows to see detailed numbers
- Click on specific paths to highlight the complete journey
- Understand bottlenecks and success patterns

### Vulnerabilities Timeline

Track vulnerability trends over time:
- Discovery patterns
- Resolution rates
- Accumulation trends
- Historical comparisons

Use this chart to:
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Measure improvement over time
- Predict future vulnerability loads

### Remediation Status

Current state of all remediation efforts:
- Completed remediations
- In-progress work
- Pending reviews
- Failed attempts requiring attention
