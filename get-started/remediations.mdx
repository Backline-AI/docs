## Overview

The Remediations page provides a comprehensive view of all ongoing efforts to fix security vulnerabilities across your organization. Remediations can be fully automated by the Backline agents or in Hybrid mode, which requires your collaboration with the agents. Take action, track progress, priorities, and the status of automated and hybrid remediation activities.

## What You'll See

- Total active remediations and distribution by mode
- SLA Violations
