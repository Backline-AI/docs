## Welcome to Backline!

Follow these simple steps to start managing your security vulnerabilities effectively.

## Step 1: Connect Your SCM

First, connect your source control management platform to allow Backline to access your repositories.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integration Hub">
    Go to **Integrations** from the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your SCM">
    Select your source control platform:
    - GitHub
    - GitLab
    - Bitbucket
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add image and packages registries">
    - Connect your private registries where internal packages are being hosted so the agents can remediate across your codebase.
    - Connect your image registries so the agents can identify vulnerabilities origin and suggest a safe fix plan
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Add Security Scanners

Connect your security scanning tools to start collecting vulnerability data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integration Hub">
    Return to the **Integrations** page if you're not already there.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Scanners">
    Connect your preferred security scanners
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure SLA">
    Set up service level agreements for your organization in the **Settings** page
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Let Backline Work Its Magic

Once your integrations are connected, Backline's agents will automatically:

- **Collect** and de-duplicate vulnerabilities from all connected sources
- **Analyze** severity and impact
- **Plan** remediation steps
- **Apply** the suggested remediation plan
- **Verify** the change applied
- **Monitor** deployment of the fix and SLA compliance

<Note>
  Initial collection of vulnerabilities may take a few minutes depending on the size of your security backlog.
</Note>

## Step 4: Explore Your Dashboard

Head to the [Dashboard](/get-started/dashboard) to view:
- Total vulnerabilities by severity
- Active remediation efforts
- SLA status and violations
- Remediation pipeline and performance metrics
