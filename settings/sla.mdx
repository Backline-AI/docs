## Overview

SLA (Service Level Agreement) Settings allow you to define time-based targets for resolving security vulnerabilities based on their severity. These settings help your team prioritize work and ensure critical issues are addressed promptly.

## What is SLA by Severity?

SLA by Severity establish deadlines for vulnerability remediation:
- Define maximum resolution times for each severity level
- Track compliance with organizational security policies
- Identify overdue vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- Measure team performance against security standards

## Accessing SLA by Severity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Click on **Settings** in the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select SLA">
    Choose **SLA** from the settings menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    View and modify SLA policies for different severity levels.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Default SLA Values

    **3 days** - Highest priority requiring immediate action
  </Card>
  <Card title="High" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **14 days** - Significant risk requiring prompt resolution
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **30 days** - Moderate risk to be addressed within a month
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low" icon="circle-info">

## How SLAs Work

### SLA Tracking

Once configured, Backline:
- Starts the SLA clock when a vulnerability is detected
- Displays time remaining or overdue status for each vulnerability
- Highlights SLA violations on the Dashboard
- Includes SLA status in the Vulnerabilities and Remediations pages


## Using SLA Data

### Dashboard Monitoring

The Dashboard shows:
- Total SLA violations across all severities
- Trend of violations over time
- Percentage of vulnerabilities resolved within SLA

### Filtering by SLA

Use SLA filters to:
- View all overdue vulnerabilities
- Find issues approaching their deadline
- Prioritize work based on time remaining


### Considerations When Setting SLAs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regulatory Compliance">
    Ensure your SLA settings meet industry regulations and compliance requirements:
    - PCI DSS often requires critical vulnerabilities to be addressed within 30 days
    - HIPAA and other healthcare regulations may have stricter requirements
    - Financial services may need faster response times
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team Capacity">
    Set realistic SLAs based on your team's capacity:
    - Consider your team size and expertise
    - Account for testing and deployment time
    - Factor in existing workload and priorities
    - Allow buffer time for complex remediations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk Tolerance">
    Align SLAs with your organization's risk appetite:
    - More risk-averse organizations may need tighter SLAs
    - Consider the nature of your business and data sensitivity
    - Balance security needs with operational practicality
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resource Availability">
    Consider practical constraints:
    - Availability of development resources
    - Testing and QA requirements
    - Deployment windows and schedules
    - Dependencies on third-party vendors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
